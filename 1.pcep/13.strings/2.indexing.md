# Indexing
**Indexing** in Python refers to accessing individual elements of a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) by their position, known as an **index**. Indexes in Python are zero-based, which means the first element is at index `0`, the second element is at index `1`, and so on.

### Indexing Syntax:
To access an element from a sequence, you use square brackets `[]` with the index of the element.

```python
sequence[index]
```

### 1. **Indexing Strings**
Each character in a string can be accessed by its index.

```python
text = "Python"
# Accessing the first character
first_char = text[0]
print(first_char)  # Output: P

# Accessing the third character
third_char = text[2]
print(third_char)  # Output: t
```

### 2. **Negative Indexing**
Python supports **negative indexing**, where `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` refers to the second-to-last element, and so on.

```python
text = "Python"
# Accessing the last character
last_char = text[-1]
print(last_char)  # Output: n

# Accessing the second-to-last character
second_last_char = text[-2]
print(second_last_char)  # Output: o
```

### 3. **Indexing Lists**
Lists, like strings, support indexing, where each element can be accessed using its index.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Accessing the first element
first_element = numbers[0]
print(first_element)  # Output: 10

# Accessing the last element using negative indexing
last_element = numbers[-1]
print(last_element)  # Output: 50
```

### 4. **Slicing with Indexing**
In addition to single-element indexing, you can use **slicing** to access a range of elements. The syntax is:
```python
sequence[start:end]
```
Where `start` is the index to begin from (inclusive) and `end` is the index to stop at (exclusive).

```python
text = "Python"
# Getting a slice from index 1 to 3
slice_text = text[1:4]  # The character at index 4 is not included
print(slice_text)  # Output: yth
```

You can also use a step value in slicing:
```python
text = "Python"
# Getting every second character
step_slice = text[0:6:2]
print(step_slice)  # Output: Pto
```

### 5. **Out-of-Range Indexing**
If you try to access an element at an index that doesn't exist, Python raises an `IndexError`.

```python
text = "Python"
# Accessing an out-of-range index
try:
    char = text[10]  # This will raise an IndexError
except IndexError:
    print("Index out of range!")
```

### Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig"]

# Accessing the first and last elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]  # 'apple'
last_fruit = fruits[-1]  # 'fig'

# Slicing to get the first three elements
first_three_fruits = fruits[0:3]  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

print(f"First fruit: {first_fruit}")
print(f"Last fruit: {last_fruit}")
print(f"First three fruits: {first_three_fruits}")
```

### Summary:
- **Positive indexing** starts from `0` and increases.
- **Negative indexing** starts from `-1` (last element) and decreases.
- **Slicing** allows you to extract a portion of the sequence by specifying start and end indices.
