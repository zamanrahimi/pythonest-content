# Key Error
In Python, a **`KeyError`** is an exception that is raised when you try to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist in that dictionary. It is a subclass of the built-in `LookupError`, which is raised for all lookup errors, including those for lists, dictionaries, and other collections.

### Characteristics of KeyError

- **Dictionaries Only**: `KeyError` specifically applies to dictionary operations and occurs when you attempt to access a key that is not present.
- **Informative**: The exception provides information about the missing key, which can help in debugging.

### Example of KeyError

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how `KeyError` can occur and how to handle it:

```python
def get_value_from_dict(my_dict, key):
    try:
        # Attempt to access the dictionary with the given key
        value = my_dict[key]
        return f"The value for '{key}' is: {value}"
    except KeyError:
        return f"KeyError: The key '{key}' does not exist in the dictionary."

# Example dictionary
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Example usages
print(get_value_from_dict(my_dict, 'name'))  # Output: The value for 'name' is: Alice
print(get_value_from_dict(my_dict, 'age'))   # Output: The value for 'age' is: 30
print(get_value_from_dict(my_dict, 'country')) # Output: KeyError: The key 'country' does not exist in the dictionary.
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The `get_value_from_dict(my_dict, key)` function attempts to retrieve the value associated with `key` from the dictionary `my_dict`.

2. **Try Block**: The code to access the dictionary is enclosed within a `try` block.

3. **Except Block**: 
   - If the specified `key` does not exist in `my_dict`, a `KeyError` is raised.
   - The `except KeyError:` block catches this exception and returns a message indicating that the key is missing.

4. **Example Usages**:
   - The first call to `get_value_from_dict(my_dict, 'name')` successfully retrieves the value for the key `'name'`, which is `'Alice'`.
   - The second call to `get_value_from_dict(my_dict, 'age')` retrieves the value for the key `'age'`, which is `30`.
   - The third call to `get_value_from_dict(my_dict, 'country')` raises a `KeyError` because `'country'` is not a key in the dictionary. The exception is caught, and a message indicating the missing key is returned.

### Summary

- A **`KeyError`** occurs when trying to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist.
- It can be caught and handled gracefully to inform the user about the missing key without crashing the program.
- Properly handling `KeyError` is important for robust applications that rely on dictionary lookups.
