# Type Error
In Python, a **`TypeError`** is a built-in exception that occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. This can happen when you attempt to perform an operation on incompatible types, such as trying to add a string and an integer or passing the wrong type of argument to a function.

### Characteristics of TypeError

- **Common Scenarios**:
  - Attempting to perform arithmetic operations with incompatible types.
  - Trying to concatenate strings with non-string types.
  - Passing arguments of the wrong type to functions or methods.
- **Use Case**: `TypeError` helps identify bugs related to type mismatches, encouraging better type checking and validation in code.

### Example of TypeError

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how `TypeError` can occur and how to handle it:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        return a + b  # Attempt to add two values
    except TypeError:
        return "TypeError: Unsupported operand types for addition."

# Valid addition
print(add_numbers(5, 10))          # Output: 15
print(add_numbers("Hello, ", "World!"))  # Output: Hello, World!

# Invalid addition (string and integer)
print(add_numbers(5, "10"))        # Output: TypeError: Unsupported operand types for addition.

# Invalid addition (list and integer)
print(add_numbers([1, 2], 3))      # Output: TypeError: Unsupported operand types for addition.
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `add_numbers(a, b)` takes two parameters and attempts to add them.

2. **Try Block**: 
   - The code tries to return the result of the addition operation (`a + b`).

3. **Except Block**:
   - The `except TypeError:` block catches the `TypeError` exception. If the operation fails due to incompatible types, a message indicating the error is returned.

4. **Example Usages**:
   - The first call `add_numbers(5, 10)` adds two integers, returning the result `15`.
   - The second call `add_numbers("Hello, ", "World!")` concatenates two strings successfully, resulting in `Hello, World!`.
   - The third call `add_numbers(5, "10")` tries to add an integer and a string, raising a `TypeError` and returning an error message.
   - The fourth call `add_numbers([1, 2], 3)` attempts to add a list and an integer, which also results in a `TypeError`.

### Summary

- **`TypeError`** is an exception raised when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
- It commonly occurs with arithmetic operations, type mismatches, and incorrect function arguments.
- By using `try` and `except` blocks, you can catch `TypeError` and provide meaningful feedback about the nature of the error, improving debugging and user experience.
