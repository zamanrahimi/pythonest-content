# Lookup Error
In Python, **`LookupError`** is a built-in exception that serves as the base class for exceptions that occur when a lookup operation fails. It is a subclass of the `StandardError` class and is specifically designed to capture errors related to accessing elements in collections, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### Common Subclasses of LookupError

- **`IndexError`**: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range in a list or tuple.
- **`KeyError`**: Raised when trying to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist.

### Characteristics of LookupError

- **Base Class**: `LookupError` itself is not usually raised directly. Instead, it is used as a base for more specific lookup-related exceptions.
- **Catching Errors**: By catching `LookupError`, you can handle any lookup-related exceptions (like `IndexError` and `KeyError`) in a unified way.

### Example of LookupError

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `LookupError` by catching both `IndexError` and `KeyError`:

```python
def access_list_and_dict(data_list, data_dict, index, key):
    try:
        # Attempt to access an element in the list
        element = data_list[index]
        print(f"Element at index {index}: {element}")

        # Attempt to access a value in the dictionary
        value = data_dict[key]
        print(f"Value for key '{key}': {value}")

    except LookupError as e:
        print(f"LookupError: {e}")
    except IndexError as e:
        print(f"IndexError: {e}. Please check the list index.")
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"KeyError: {e}. Please check the dictionary key.")

# Example data
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# Valid access
access_list_and_dict(my_list, my_dict, 1, 'b')  # Output: Element at index 1: 20; Value for key 'b': 2

# Accessing an invalid index
access_list_and_dict(my_list, my_dict, 5, 'b')  # Output: LookupError: list index out of range

# Accessing an invalid key
access_list_and_dict(my_list, my_dict, 1, 'd')  # Output: LookupError: 'd'
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `access_list_and_dict(data_list, data_dict, index, key)` takes a list, a dictionary, an index, and a key as parameters.

2. **Try Block**: 
   - The code attempts to access an element in the list using the provided index and a value in the dictionary using the provided key.
   - If both accesses are successful, the results are printed.

3. **Except Blocks**:
   - The first `except LookupError as e:` block is designed to catch any lookup-related exceptions, but it won't catch `IndexError` or `KeyError` because these are handled in their respective blocks below it.
   - The `IndexError` block catches cases where the index is out of range and provides a specific message.
   - The `KeyError` block handles cases where the key does not exist in the dictionary.

4. **Example Usages**:
   - The first call `access_list_and_dict(my_list, my_dict, 1, 'b')` accesses valid elements, resulting in successful output.
   - The second call attempts to access an index (`5`) that is out of range, leading to an `IndexError`.
   - The third call tries to access a non-existent key (`'d'`) in the dictionary, raising a `KeyError`.

### Summary

- **`LookupError`** is a base class for exceptions that occur during lookup operations, such as accessing elements in lists or keys in dictionaries.
- It provides a way to handle these errors collectively but is usually not raised directly. Instead, specific exceptions like `IndexError` and `KeyError` are raised in cases of invalid accesses.
- Catching `LookupError` allows you to manage lookup-related errors in a more general way if desired.
