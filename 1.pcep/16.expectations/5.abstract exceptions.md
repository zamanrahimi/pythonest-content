# abstract exceptions
In Python, **abstract exceptions** refer to exceptions that are not meant to be instantiated directly or caught explicitly. The most common example is the `BaseException` class and its subclasses, which define a hierarchy of exception types. However, Python also allows for the creation of custom exception classes that can serve as abstract base classes for specific error types.

### Characteristics of Abstract Exceptions

- **Inheritance**: Abstract exceptions are often used as base classes from which other exceptions can derive. They typically don't contain implementation details but provide a common interface for handling specific types of errors.
- **Not Instantiated**: Abstract exceptions are not intended to be raised or caught directly. Instead, derived exceptions that implement specific functionality should be used.
- **Custom Abstract Exceptions**: You can define your own abstract exceptions by subclassing `Exception` or another relevant base class.

### Example of Using Abstract Exceptions

Hereâ€™s an example that illustrates the concept of abstract exceptions by defining a custom abstract exception class and its derived classes:

```python
class MyBaseException(Exception):
    """Abstract base exception for custom errors."""
    pass

class ValueTooLowError(MyBaseException):
    """Exception raised when a value is too low."""
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        super().__init__(f"Value {value} is too low.")

class ValueTooHighError(MyBaseException):
    """Exception raised when a value is too high."""
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        super().__init__(f"Value {value} is too high.")

def check_value(value):
    if value < 10:
        raise ValueTooLowError(value)
    elif value > 100:
        raise ValueTooHighError(value)
    else:
        return "Value is within the acceptable range."

# Example usage
try:
    print(check_value(5))   # Raises ValueTooLowError
except MyBaseException as e:
    print(e)

try:
    print(check_value(150)) # Raises ValueTooHighError
except MyBaseException as e:
    print(e)

# Successful case
try:
    print(check_value(50))  # Should pass without exceptions
except MyBaseException as e:
    print(e)
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Custom Abstract Exception**: 
   - The `MyBaseException` class is defined as a subclass of `Exception`. This serves as an abstract base exception for custom errors.
   - It does not contain any additional implementation and is intended to be subclassed.

2. **Derived Exceptions**: 
   - `ValueTooLowError` and `ValueTooHighError` are defined as specific exceptions that inherit from `MyBaseException`. Each of these classes has an `__init__` method to customize the error message based on the value that caused the exception.

3. **Function Definition**: 
   - The `check_value(value)` function checks if the input value is within an acceptable range:
     - If the value is less than 10, it raises a `ValueTooLowError`.
     - If the value is greater than 100, it raises a `ValueTooHighError`.
     - If the value is within range, it returns a success message.

4. **Example Usages**:
   - The first `try` block calls `check_value(5)`, which raises `ValueTooLowError`. The exception is caught, and its message is printed.
   - The second `try` block calls `check_value(150)`, which raises `ValueTooHighError`. Again, the exception is caught and its message is printed.
   - The third `try` block calls `check_value(50)`, which is within the acceptable range, so no exceptions are raised, and the success message is printed.

### Summary

- Abstract exceptions in Python serve as base classes for creating a hierarchy of specific exception types.
- They provide a way to define a common interface for handling errors while allowing for more specific error handling with derived exception classes.
- This approach promotes code organization, reusability, and clarity when dealing with various error conditions in your programs.
