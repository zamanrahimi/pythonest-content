# Keyboard Interrupt
In Python, a **`KeyboardInterrupt`** exception is raised when the user interrupts the program's execution, typically by pressing `Ctrl+C` on the keyboard. This exception is a subclass of `BaseException` and is used to gracefully handle situations where a program needs to be stopped manually by the user.

### Characteristics of KeyboardInterrupt

- **Interrupt Signal**: The `KeyboardInterrupt` exception allows a program to respond to user requests for interruption, providing an opportunity to perform cleanup operations if necessary.
- **Default Behavior**: By default, if a `KeyboardInterrupt` is not caught, the program will terminate immediately, and an error message will be displayed.

### Example of KeyboardInterrupt

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how to handle a `KeyboardInterrupt` in a Python program:

```python
import time

def long_running_task():
    try:
        print("Starting a long-running task. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
        # Simulate a long-running task with a loop
        for i in range(10):
            time.sleep(1)  # Sleep for 1 second
            print(f"Working... {i+1} seconds passed")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nTask interrupted! Cleaning up resources...")
    finally:
        print("Exiting gracefully.")

# Run the long-running task
long_running_task()
print("Program has finished.")
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Import time**: The `time` module is imported to simulate a delay during the long-running task.

2. **Function Definition**: The `long_running_task()` function simulates a task that takes time to complete.

3. **Try Block**: 
   - The task runs in a loop, simulating work by sleeping for 1 second on each iteration.
   - A message is printed every second to indicate progress.

4. **Except Block**: 
   - If the user presses `Ctrl+C` while the program is running, a `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised.
   - The `except KeyboardInterrupt:` block catches this exception and executes the code inside it, which includes a message indicating that the task was interrupted.

5. **Finally Block**: 
   - The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup code, ensuring that resources are released or messages are printed before the program exits.

6. **Program Flow**: After the `long_running_task()` function finishes or is interrupted, the final message "Program has finished." is printed.

### Summary

- The **`KeyboardInterrupt`** exception allows a Python program to handle user interruptions gracefully.
- By catching this exception, you can perform cleanup operations or log messages before the program exits.
- This approach enhances the user experience by providing a way to exit long-running tasks without leaving resources in an inconsistent state.
