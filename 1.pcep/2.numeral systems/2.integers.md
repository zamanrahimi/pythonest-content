# Integers in Python

An **integer** in Python is a whole number (positive, negative, or zero) without a fractional or decimal part. Integers belong to the `int` data type in Python and are used to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Characteristics of Integers

- They can be positive or negative.
- They do not have a fractional or decimal part.
- Python automatically handles large integers without size limits (unlike some other programming languages).

## Example of Integers

```python
# Positive integer
x = 10

# Negative integer
y = -5

# Zero is also an integer
z = 0

# Performing arithmetic operations with integers
sum_result = x + y  # 10 + (-5) = 5
product_result = x * 2  # 10 * 2 = 20
```

### Explanation

- `x = 10`, `y = -5`, and `z = 0` are integers assigned to variables.
- You can perform operations such as addition (`x + y`), multiplication (`x * 2`), etc., using these integer values.

## Integer Operations

Here are a few common operations you can perform with integers in Python:

- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`*`)
- **Division** (`/`): Always returns a float.
- **Integer Division** (`//`): Returns the integer part of the division.
- **Modulus** (`%`): Returns the remainder of the division.
- **Exponentiation** (`**`): Raises a number to the power of another.

## Example of Integer Operations

```python
a = 15
b = 4

# Addition
print(a + b)  # Output: 19

# Subtraction
print(a - b)  # Output: 11

# Multiplication
print(a * b)  # Output: 60

# Division (result will be a float)
print(a / b)  # Output: 3.75

# Integer division (no decimal part)
print(a // b)  # Output: 3

# Modulus (remainder of the division)
print(a % b)  # Output: 3

# Exponentiation (a raised to the power of b)
print(a ** b)  # Output: 50625 (15^4)
```

### Explanation python code

- The above code shows different arithmetic operations using integers.
  - **Division** (`a / b`) results in a float (even though `a` and `b` are integers).
  - **Integer division** (`a // b`) discards the decimal part.
  - **Modulus** (`a % b`) gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.
  - **Exponentiation** (`a ** b`) raises `a` to the power of `b`.
