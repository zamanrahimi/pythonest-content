# Octal

**Octal** is a base-8 numeral system that uses eight digits: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, and `7`. In Python, octal numbers are represented with a prefix `0o` (or `0O`), indicating that the number following it is in octal format.

Octal representation is less commonly used than binary and hexadecimal but can be useful in certain computing contexts, particularly when dealing with file permissions in Unix-like systems.

## How to Write Octal Numbers

To write an octal number in Python, you can use the following syntax:

```python
octal_number = 0o12  # This represents the decimal number 10
```

## Example of Octal Numbers

```python
# Defining octal numbers
a = 0o12  # Octal for decimal 10
b = 0o15  # Octal for decimal 13

# Performing arithmetic operations with octal numbers
sum_result = a + b  # 10 + 13 = 23 in decimal
print("Sum in decimal:", sum_result)  # Output: 23

# Converting octal to decimal
decimal_a = int('12', 8)  # Converting octal string to decimal
print("Decimal value of '12':", decimal_a)  # Output: 10
```

### Explanation

- `a` is defined as `0o12`, which is octal for the decimal number `10`.
- `b` is defined as `0o15`, which is octal for the decimal number `13`.
- When we add `a` and `b`, the result is `23` in decimal, which is printed.

## Converting Octal to Decimal

You can convert an octal number (as a string) to a decimal using the `int()` function, specifying the base as `8`.

```python
# Convert octal string to decimal
octal_string = '17'  # Octal representation of 15
decimal_value = int(octal_string, 8)  # Convert to decimal
print("Decimal value of '17':", decimal_value)  # Output: 15
```

### Explanation code

- The string `'17'` represents the octal number for `15`.
- Using `int(octal_string, 8)` converts the octal string to its decimal equivalent, which is `15`.

## Octal Arithmetic Operations

You can perform various arithmetic operations with octal numbers, and the results will be in decimal format.

### Example

```python
x = 0o10  # Octal for 8
y = 0o07  # Octal for 7

# Addition
addition_result = x + y  # 8 + 7 = 15
print("Addition (8 + 7):", oct(addition_result))  # Output: 0o17

# Subtraction
subtraction_result = x - y  # 8 - 7 = 1
print("Subtraction (8 - 7):", oct(subtraction_result))  # Output: 0o1

# Multiplication
multiplication_result = x * y  # 8 * 7 = 56
print("Multiplication (8 * 7):", oct(multiplication_result))  # Output: 0o70

# Division
division_result = x // y  # Integer division
print("Division (8 // 7):", oct(division_result))  # Output: 0o1
```

### Explanation python code

- The results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of octal numbers are calculated.
- The results are printed in octal format using the `oct()` function, which converts a decimal number back to octal.
