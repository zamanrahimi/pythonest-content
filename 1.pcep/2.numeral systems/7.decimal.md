# Decimal

**Decimal** refers to the base-10 numeral system, which is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. In Python, the decimal numbers can be represented as integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (numbers with a fractional part).

Python has a built-in module called `decimal` that provides support for decimal floating-point arithmetic, which is especially useful for financial calculations or situations requiring a high level of precision, avoiding some of the pitfalls of binary floating-point representation.

## Using Decimal Numbers

You can use decimal numbers in Python simply by writing them as they are. However, if you need high precision, you can use the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module.

## Example of Decimal Numbers

```python
# Regular decimal numbers
a = 10          # Integer decimal
b = 3.14        # Floating-point decimal

# Performing arithmetic operations
sum_result = a + b        # 10 + 3.14 = 13.14
difference_result = a - b  # 10 - 3.14 = 6.86
product_result = a * b     # 10 * 3.14 = 31.4
division_result = a / b    # 10 / 3.14 â‰ˆ 3.18

print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Division:", division_result)
```

### Explanation code

- `a` is an integer decimal (`10`), and `b` is a floating-point decimal (`3.14`).
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are performed using these decimal numbers, resulting in decimal outputs.

## Using the Decimal Module

To achieve greater precision, especially in financial calculations, you can use the `decimal` module.

## Example Using the `decimal` Module

```python
from decimal import Decimal

# Creating Decimal numbers
x = Decimal('10.5')  # Use strings to avoid precision issues
y = Decimal('3.14')

# Performing arithmetic operations with Decimal
sum_decimal = x + y          # 10.5 + 3.14 = 13.64
product_decimal = x * y      # 10.5 * 3.14 = 32.97

print("Sum with Decimal:", sum_decimal)        # Output: 13.64
print("Product with Decimal:", product_decimal)  # Output: 32.97
```

### Explanation

- The `Decimal` class is imported from the `decimal` module.
- Decimal numbers are created using strings to avoid precision issues that can occur with floating-point representation.
- Arithmetic operations are performed, and results maintain a high level of precision.

## Advantages of Using the Decimal Module

1. **Precision**: It provides precise control over decimal representation and can handle large numbers accurately.
2. **Avoiding Rounding Errors**: Useful in financial applications where rounding errors in floating-point arithmetic can lead to incorrect results.
3. **Customizable Precision**: You can set the precision for your decimal operations to suit your needs.

## Example of Setting Precision

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Setting precision to 4 decimal places
getcontext().prec = 4

# Creating Decimal numbers
num1 = Decimal('1.23456')
num2 = Decimal('2.34567')

# Performing arithmetic with set precision
result = num1 + num2
print("Result with custom precision:", result)  # Output: 3.580
```

### Explanation python code

- The precision for decimal calculations is set using `getcontext().prec`.
- When performing arithmetic, the result is rounded according to the specified precision.
