# Binary

**Binary** is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two digits: `0` and `1`. In Python, binary numbers are represented with a prefix `0b` (or `0B`), indicating that the number following it is in binary format.

Binary representation is essential in computer science and programming because computers operate using binary logic at the hardware level.

## How to Write Binary Numbers in Python

To write a binary number in Python, you can use the following syntax:

```python
binary_number = 0b1010  # This represents the decimal number 10
```

## Example of Binary Numbers

```python
# Defining binary numbers
a = 0b1010  # Binary for decimal 10
b = 0b1101  # Binary for decimal 13

# Performing arithmetic operations with binary numbers
sum_result = a + b  # 10 + 13 = 23 in decimal
print("Sum in decimal:", sum_result)  # Output: 23

# Converting binary to decimal
decimal_a = int('1010', 2)  # Converting binary string to decimal
print("Decimal value of 1010:", decimal_a)  # Output: 10
```

### Explanation

- `a` is defined as `0b1010`, which is binary for the decimal number `10`.
- `b` is defined as `0b1101`, which is binary for the decimal number `13`.
- When we add `a` and `b`, the result is `23` in decimal, which is printed.

## Converting Binary to Decimal

You can convert a binary number (as a string) to a decimal using the `int()` function, specifying the base as `2`.

```python
# Convert binary string to decimal
binary_string = '1101'  # Binary representation of 13
decimal_value = int(binary_string, 2)  # Convert to decimal
print("Decimal value of '1101':", decimal_value)  # Output: 13
```

### Explanation code

- The string `'1101'` represents the binary number for `13`.
- Using `int(binary_string, 2)` converts the binary string to its decimal equivalent, which is `13`.

## Binary Arithmetic Operations

You can perform various arithmetic operations with binary numbers, and the results will be in decimal format.

### Example

```python
x = 0b1010  # Binary for 10
y = 0b0011  # Binary for 3

# Addition
addition_result = x + y  # 10 + 3 = 13
print("Addition (10 + 3):", bin(addition_result))  # Output: 0b1101

# Subtraction
subtraction_result = x - y  # 10 - 3 = 7
print("Subtraction (10 - 3):", bin(subtraction_result))  # Output: 0b111

# Multiplication
multiplication_result = x * y  # 10 * 3 = 30
print("Multiplication (10 * 3):", bin(multiplication_result))  # Output: 0b11110

# Division
division_result = x // y  # Integer division
print("Division (10 // 3):", bin(division_result))  # Output: 0b11
```

### Explanation python code

- The results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of binary numbers are calculated.
- The results are printed in binary format using the `bin()` function, which converts a decimal number back to binary.
