# Scientific Notation

**Scientific notation** in Python is a way of representing very large or very small numbers in a compact form. In scientific notation, numbers are expressed as a product of a base and a power of 10. It is commonly used in scientific calculations to handle extremely large or small numbers efficiently.

In Python, scientific notation is written using an **exponent** symbol, `e` or `E`, followed by the power of 10.

## Format

- `a * 10^b` is written as `aeb` or `aEb`, where:
  - `a` is the **base** (a float or integer).
  - `b` is the **exponent** (an integer).

For example:

- `1.23 * 10^3` is written as `1.23e3` (which equals `1230`).
- `4.56 * 10^-2` is written as `4.56e-2` (which equals `0.0456`).

## Example of Scientific Notation in Python

```python
# Large number using scientific notation
large_number = 1.23e4  # This means 1.23 * 10^4 = 12300.0
print(large_number)  # Output: 12300.0

# Small number using scientific notation
small_number = 4.56e-3  # This means 4.56 * 10^-3 = 0.00456
print(small_number)  # Output: 0.00456
```

### Explanation

- `1.23e4` is `1.23 * 10^4`, which is equal to `12300.0`.
- `4.56e-3` is `4.56 * 10^-3`, which is equal to `0.00456`.

### Why Use Scientific Notation?

1. **Handling Large Numbers**: For example, the speed of light is approximately `300,000,000` meters per second. Instead of writing all the zeros, you can represent it as `3e8`.
2. **Handling Small Numbers**: For example, the size of an atom is about `0.0000000001` meters. This can be written as `1e-10`.

## Example Using Scientific Notation for Large and Small Numbers

```python
# Representing large numbers
distance_to_sun = 1.496e11  # Distance to the Sun in meters (1.496 * 10^11)
print("Distance to the Sun:", distance_to_sun)  # Output: 149600000000.0

# Representing small numbers
electron_mass = 9.109e-31  # Mass of an electron in kilograms (9.109 * 10^-31)
print("Mass of an electron:", electron_mass)  # Output: 9.109e-31
```

### Explanation python code

- `1.496e11` represents the distance to the Sun, which is `149,600,000,000` meters.
- `9.109e-31` represents the mass of an electron, a very small number.

## Performing Calculations with Scientific Notation

You can perform arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) directly on numbers in scientific notation.

```python
# Multiplication of two numbers in scientific notation
result = (1.2e3) * (3.4e2)  # (1.2 * 10^3) * (3.4 * 10^2) = 408000.0
print(result)  # Output: 408000.0

# Addition of numbers in scientific notation
result = (2.5e6) + (3.5e5)  # (2.5 * 10^6) + (3.5 * 10^5) = 2850000.0
print(result)  # Output: 2850000.0
```
