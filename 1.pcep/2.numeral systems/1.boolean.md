# Boolean in Python

A **Boolean** in Python is a data type that represents one of two values: `True` or `False`. These values are useful when making decisions in code, typically in conditional statements (like `if` statements) or logical expressions.

## Boolean Values

- `True`: Represents a condition that is correct or true.
- `False`: Represents a condition that is incorrect or false.

In Python, Boolean values belong to the data type `bool`, which is a subclass of the `int` type. Internally, Python treats `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`.

## Boolean Expressions

A **Boolean expression** is any expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. Common Boolean expressions include:

- Comparisons (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical operators (e.g., `and`, `or`, `not`)

## Example of Boolean Expressions

```python
# Boolean literals
is_active = True
is_logged_in = False

# Comparison expressions
a = 5
b = 10
print(a > b)  # Output: False, since 5 is not greater than 10

# Logical expressions
result = (a < b) and is_active  # True, since both a < b and is_active are True
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### Explanation

- `is_active = True` and `is_logged_in = False` are examples of Boolean literals.
- `a > b` checks if `a` is greater than `b`, which evaluates to `False`.
- The logical expression `(a < b) and is_active` combines two conditions. It checks if `a` is less than `b` and if `is_active` is `True`. Since both conditions are `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.

## Boolean and Conditional Statements

Booleans are commonly used in **if** statements to control the flow of a program based on conditions.

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")  # This block runs because age >= 18 is True
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### Explanation python code

- The condition `age >= 18` evaluates to `True`, so the message "You are an adult." is printed.

## Boolean as Numbers

Since `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0`, you can perform arithmetic with Booleans.

```python
x = True
y = False

# Performing arithmetic
print(x + 5)  # Output: 6 (True is treated as 1, so 1 + 5 = 6)
print(y + 5)  # Output: 5 (False is treated as 0, so 0 + 5 = 5)
```
