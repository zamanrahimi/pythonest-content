# PEP-8

**PEP-8** (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the official style guide for Python code. It provides a set of conventions to help Python developers write more readable and maintainable code by following consistent formatting and structuring rules.

## Key Guidelines from PEP-8

1. **Indentation:**

   - Use **4 spaces** per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
   - Consistent indentation improves code readability.

   ```python
   def my_function():
       if True:
           print("This is indented correctly.")
   ```

2. **Line Length:**

   - Limit all lines to a maximum of **79 characters**. This ensures the code is easy to read without needing to scroll horizontally.

3. **Blank Lines:**

   - Use **2 blank lines** to separate top-level functions and class definitions, and **1 blank line** to separate methods within a class.
   - Separate logical sections of code with blank lines.

4. **Imports:**

   - Imports should always be at the top of the file, right after any module comments or docstrings.
   - Group imports in the following order
     1. Standard library imports
     2. Related third-party imports
     3. Local application/library-specific imports
   - Use one import per line.

   ```python
   import os
   import sys

   from django.conf import settings
   from myapp.models import User
   ```

5. **Whitespace:**

   - Avoid extraneous whitespace inside parentheses, brackets, and braces.
   - Use spaces around operators and after commas but not directly inside function calls.

   ```python
   # Correct
   result = (x + y) * (a + b)

   # Incorrect
   result = ( x + y ) * ( a + b )
   ```

6. **Naming Conventions:**

   - Follow naming conventions like `snake_case` for variable and function names, `PascalCase` for class names, and `UPPER_CASE` for constants (as explained in the previous response).

7. **Comments:**

   - Use comments to explain why something is done, not just what is done.
   - Use block comments for explaining sections of code, and inline comments sparingly.

   ```python
   # Calculate the area of a circle
   def calculate_area(radius):
       # Formula for area: pi * r^2
       return 3.14159 * (radius ** 2)
   ```

8. **Docstrings:**

   - Always use **docstrings** to describe the purpose of functions, classes, and methods. Use triple quotes (`"""`).

   ```python
   def calculate_area(radius):
       """
       Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

       Args:
           radius (float): The radius of the circle.

       Returns:
           float: The area of the circle.
       """
       return 3.14159 * (radius ** 2)
   ```

## Example Following PEP-8 Guidelines

```python
import math

class Circle:
    """
    Represents a circle with a given radius.
    """

    def __init__(self, radius):
        """
        Initializes a Circle instance with the given radius.

        Args:
            radius (float): The radius of the circle.
        """
        self.radius = radius

    def calculate_area(self):
        """
        Calculates the area of the circle.

        Returns:
            float: The area of the circle.
        """
        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)


# Example usage
circle = Circle(5)
print(f"The area of the circle is: {circle.calculate_area()}")
```

### Key PEP-8 Elements in this Example

- **4 spaces for indentation**.
- **Docstrings** explaining the purpose of the class and its methods.
- **Import statement** at the top of the file.
- **Spaces around operators** (`math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)`).
- **Class and method separation with a blank line**.
