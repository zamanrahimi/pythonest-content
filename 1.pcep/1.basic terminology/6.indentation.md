# Indentation

In Python, **indentation** refers to the use of spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line to define the structure of code. Unlike some other programming languages that use braces `{}` or keywords to define code blocks, Python relies on indentation to group statements together.

## Why Indentation Matters

Indentation is essential in Python because it indicates which statements belong to a particular block of code. It’s required for certain structures, like `if` statements, loops, and functions. Failing to indent properly will result in a syntax error.

## Rules for Indentation in Python

1. Each block of code inside an `if`, `for`, `while`, or function definition must be indented.
2. Python recommends using 4 spaces per indentation level.
3. Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation is not allowed, and will cause errors.

## Example

```python
# A simple function definition
def greet(name):
    # This line is indented and part of the function
    if name:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # This line is indented and part of the if block
    else:
        print("Hello, stranger!")  # This is also indented and part of the else block
```

## Explanation

- **`def greet(name):`**: This defines a function. The next line inside the function is indented to show it belongs to the function block.
- **`if name:`**: This checks if `name` is not empty. The two lines inside the `if` and `else` are indented further to show they are part of the respective blocks.
- Without indentation, Python wouldn’t know which code belongs to the function or the conditional blocks, and it would raise an error.

## Incorrect Indentation Example

```python
def greet(name):
if name:  # No indentation, this will cause an error
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
else:
    print("Hello, stranger!")
```

In this example, because the `if` block is not indented, Python would raise an **IndentationError**.
