# Instructions

In Python, **instructions** refer to commands or statements that direct the computer to perform a specific task. These instructions can include things like declaring variables, performing calculations, making decisions (with `if` statements), or repeating actions (using loops).

Hereâ€™s a simple example to explain the concept of instructions in Python:

## Example:

```python
# Instruction 1: Declare a variable and assign a value
x = 5

# Instruction 2: Perform a calculation
y = x + 3

# Instruction 3: Make a decision using an if statement
if y > 5:
    print("y is greater than 5")
else:
    print("y is not greater than 5")

# Instruction 4: Use a loop to repeat actions
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Loop iteration {i + 1}")
```

## Explanation:

1. **Instruction 1: `x = 5`**  
   This is an assignment instruction that assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`.

2. **Instruction 2: `y = x + 3`**  
   This instruction adds `3` to the value of `x` and assigns the result to the variable `y`.

3. **Instruction 3: `if y > 5:`**  
   This is a conditional instruction. It checks if `y` is greater than 5. If true, it executes the code block inside the `if` statement, otherwise it runs the code inside the `else` block.

4. **Instruction 4: `for i in range(3):`**  
   This is a loop instruction that repeats the code block inside the `for` loop 3 times (since `range(3)` generates values 0, 1, and 2).
