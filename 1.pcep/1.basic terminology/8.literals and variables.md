# Literals and Variables in Python

Literals** and **variables\*\* are key components of programming in Python. They work together to store and manipulate data.

## 1. Literals

**Literals** are raw, fixed values in Python that represent constant data. When you write a number, string, or other data type directly in your code, it is considered a literal.

### Types of Literals

- **Numeric Literals**:

  - **Integer**: Whole numbers.
    - Example: `42`, `100`
  - **Float**: Numbers with a decimal point.
    - Example: `3.14`, `0.99`
  - **Complex**: Numbers with a real and imaginary part.
    - Example: `5 + 2j`

- **String Literals**: Text enclosed in quotes (single or double).

  - Example: `'Hello'`, `"World"`

- **Boolean Literals**: Values representing truth.

  - Example: `True`, `False`

- **None Literal**: Represents no value or a null value.
  - Example: `None`

### Example of Literals

```python
# Numeric literals
a = 10       # Integer
b = 3.14     # Float

# String literal
name = "Python"  # String

# Boolean literal
is_valid = True  # Boolean

# None literal
value = None     # NoneType
```

In this example:

- `10`, `3.14`, `"Python"`, `True`, and `None` are **literals**.

## 2. Variables

**Variables** are names that act as containers for storing data. You can assign literals to variables, which means that a variable holds a reference to the literal value.

- Variables in Python are created when you assign a value to them.
- Variables can store different types of data, and their value can be changed throughout the program.

### Rules for Naming Variables

1. A variable name must start with a letter or underscore.
2. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (but cannot start with a number).
3. Variable names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different).

### Example of Variables

```python
# Assigning values to variables
age = 25        # 'age' is a variable holding the integer literal 25
height = 5.8    # 'height' is a variable holding the float literal 5.8
greeting = "Hi" # 'greeting' is a variable holding the string literal "Hi"

# Changing variable values
age = 30        # 'age' is now updated to 30
```

In this example:

- `age`, `height`, and `greeting` are **variables** that store literal values.
- The value of `age` was updated from `25` to `30`.

### Difference Between Literals and Variables

- **Literals** are fixed values written directly into the code (such as `25`, `"Hi"`, or `True`).
- **Variables** are containers that hold these values and allow you to reuse and manipulate the data.

### Example Combining Both

```python
# Literal values assigned to variables
x = 100           # 100 is a literal, x is a variable
y = 20.5          # 20.5 is a literal, y is a variable

# Performing operations with variables
z = x + y         # z stores the result of adding x and y

# Printing the result
print(z)          # Output: 120.5
```

Here:

- `100` and `20.5` are literals.
- `x`, `y`, and `z` are variables holding and manipulating those values.
