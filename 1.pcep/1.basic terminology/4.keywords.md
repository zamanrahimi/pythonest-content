# Keywords

In Python, **keywords** are reserved words that have a specific meaning to the Python interpreter. These words are part of the syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, etc.). Python keywords define the structure and rules of the language.

Here are a few examples of Python keywords:

- `if`
- `else`
- `while`
- `for`
- `def`
- `return`
- `class`

## Example

```python
# Example using Python keywords: if, else, and return

def check_number(num):
    if num > 0:
        return "Positive number"
    elif num < 0:
        return "Negative number"
    else:
        return "Zero"

# Testing the function
print(check_number(10))  # Output: Positive number
print(check_number(-5))  # Output: Negative number
print(check_number(0))   # Output: Zero
```

## Explanation

- `def`: Defines a function called `check_number`.
- `if`: Starts a conditional statement.
- `elif`: Checks another condition if the first `if` is not true.
- `else`: Executes if none of the previous conditions are true.
- `return`: Used to return a value from the function.
