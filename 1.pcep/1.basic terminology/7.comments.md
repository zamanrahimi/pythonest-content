# Comments

**Comments** in Python are used to leave notes or explanations within the code that the Python interpreter ignores during execution. They are helpful for adding clarity, explanations, or reminders about how a specific part of the code works, both for yourself and other developers reading the code.

## Types of Comments in Python

There are two main types of comments in Python:

1. **Single-line comments**
2. **Multi-line comments**

### 1. Single-line Comments

A **single-line comment** begins with a `#` symbol. Everything after the `#` on that line is ignored by the interpreter.

### Example

```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # Assign the value 10 to variable x
print(x)  # Print the value of x
```

- In this example, the comments provide explanations for what each line of code does.

### 2. Multi-line Comments

Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments. However, you can achieve this by either using multiple single-line comments or using a multi-line string (enclosed in triple quotes). The latter is often used as a **docstring**, especially for documenting functions and classes.

#### Example

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across multiple lines.
However, this is technically a string and is not ignored like single-line comments.
"""
def greet(name):
    """This function prints a greeting message."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

- In this example, the triple quotes create a block of text that serves as a comment or a docstring, typically used for documentation purposes inside functions or classes.

## Why Use Comments?

1. **Improve Code Readability**: Comments make the code easier to understand by explaining what it does.
2. **Collaborate Effectively**: When working with others, comments help others understand your code quickly.
3. **Reminders**: They act as reminders for yourself when revisiting code after some time.
