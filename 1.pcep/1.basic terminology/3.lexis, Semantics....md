# lexis, syntax, and semantics
In the context of programming languages like Python, lexis, syntax, and semantics are three fundamental concepts that help define how code is structured and interpreted. Here's a breakdown of each:

# 1. Lexis (Lexical Analysis)
Lexis refers to the vocabulary or the collection of tokens in a programming language. In this phase, the source code is broken down into meaningful elements called tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

Example
For the Python code:
'''python
x = 10
'''

The tokens would be:

x (identifier)
= (assignment operator)
10 (integer literal)
# 2. Syntax
Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure or form of valid statements in a programming language. It dictates how tokens can be combined to create valid statements or expressions.

**Example**
In Python, the syntax for an assignment statement requires an identifier followed by an equals sign and then a value. The previous example x = 10 is syntactically correct. However, the following example is not:

''' python
10 = x  # Syntax Error: Cannot assign to a literal'''
# 3. Semantics
Semantics deals with the meaning of the statements or expressions in a programming language. It defines what the code does when executed, regardless of its structure.

Example
Continuing with the previous code:

'''python
x = 10
print(x)
Lexical Analysis: Breaks down into tokens x, =, 10, print, and (.
'''
# Syntax: Both lines are syntactically correct.
Semantics: The meaning of this code is that it assigns the integer value 10 to the variable x, and then it prints the value of x, which will output:
10

# Summary
**Lexis:** Concerned with tokens (the "words" of the programming language).
**Syntax:** Focuses on how those tokens can be arranged (the "grammar").
**Semantics:** Relates to what the valid statements mean (the "meaning").
Understanding these concepts is essential for writing correct and meaningful Python code. If you have further questions or want more examples, feel free to ask!
