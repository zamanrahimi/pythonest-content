# lexis, syntax, and semantics

In the context of programming languages like Python, lexis, syntax, and semantics are three fundamental concepts that help define how code is structured and interpreted. Here's a breakdown of each:

## 1. Lexis (Lexical Analysis)

Lexis refers to the vocabulary or the collection of tokens in a programming language. In this phase, the source code is broken down into meaningful elements called tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

Example
For the Python code:
'''python
x = 10
'''

The tokens would be:

x (identifier)
= (assignment operator)
10 (integer literal)

## 2. Syntax

Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure or form of valid statements in a programming language. It dictates how tokens can be combined to create valid statements or expressions.

**Example**
In Python, the syntax for an assignment statement requires an identifier followed by an equals sign and then a value. The previous example x = 10 is syntactically correct. However, the following example is not:

''' python
10 = x # Syntax Error: Cannot assign to a literal'''

## 3. Semantics

Semantics deals with the meaning of the statements or expressions in a programming language. It defines what the code does when executed, regardless of its structure.

Example
Continuing with the previous code:

'''python
x = 10
print(x)
Lexical Analysis: Breaks down into tokens x, =, 10, print, and
'''

## Syntax: Both lines are syntactically correct

Semantics: The meaning of this code is that it assigns the integer value 10 to the variable x, and then it prints the value of x, which will output:
10
