# Basics of Exception Handling
**Exception handling** in Python is a mechanism that allows you to respond to errors that occur during the execution of a program. Instead of crashing when an error occurs, Python allows you to handle exceptions gracefully, providing a way to recover from the error or to inform the user.

### Basics of Exception Handling

1. **Exceptions**: An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Python has built-in exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, etc.) that can be raised when errors are detected.

2. **Try and Except Blocks**: The primary way to handle exceptions is by using `try` and `except` blocks. The code that may raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block. If an exception occurs, the code inside the `except` block will execute.

3. **Finally Block**: You can use a `finally` block after the `try` and `except` blocks. The code inside the `finally` block will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is useful for cleanup actions.

4. **Else Block**: An `else` block can be used after `except`. The code inside the `else` block will run if the `try` block executes successfully (i.e., without exceptions).

### Example of Exception Handling

Hereâ€™s a simple example that demonstrates exception handling in Python:

```python
def divide_numbers(num1, num2):
    try:
        # Attempt to divide the numbers
        result = num1 / num2
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Handle the case where the second number is zero
        return "Error: Cannot divide by zero."
    except TypeError:
        # Handle the case where inputs are not numbers
        return "Error: Please provide numbers only."
    else:
        # If no exceptions occurred, return the result
        return f"The result is: {result}"
    finally:
        # This block executes no matter what
        print("Execution of the divide_numbers function is complete.")

# Example usage
print(divide_numbers(10, 2))  # Output: The result is: 5.0
print(divide_numbers(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
print(divide_numbers(10, 'a'))  # Output: Error: Please provide numbers only.
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `divide_numbers(num1, num2)` is defined to divide two numbers.
   
2. **Try Block**: The division operation is placed inside the `try` block. If it raises a `ZeroDivisionError` (for example, if `num2` is zero), the code in the corresponding `except` block will run.

3. **Except Blocks**:
   - The first `except` block handles division by zero and returns an error message.
   - The second `except` block handles cases where the inputs are not numbers (causing a `TypeError`).

4. **Else Block**: If the division is successful (i.e., no exceptions are raised), the result is returned from the `else` block.

5. **Finally Block**: The `finally` block is executed after the `try` and `except` blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It can be used for cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources.

### Summary

- **Exception handling** is essential for writing robust and user-friendly Python programs.
- Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle potential errors without crashing the program.
- The `finally` block can be used for cleanup actions, and the `else` block can run code if no exceptions occurred.
