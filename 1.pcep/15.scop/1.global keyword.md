# global` keyword
In Python, the **`global` keyword** is used to declare that a variable inside a function is global (i.e., it refers to a variable defined outside of that function). This allows you to modify the global variable from within the function, rather than creating a new local variable with the same name.

### When to Use the Global Keyword

1. **Modifying Global Variables**: When you want to change the value of a global variable inside a function.
2. **Avoiding Name Conflicts**: To clarify that a variable is intended to refer to the global variable instead of creating a new local variable.

### Example of Using the Global Keyword

Hereâ€™s a simple example that illustrates the use of the `global` keyword:

```python
# Global variable
counter = 0

def increment_counter():
    global counter  # Declare that we want to use the global variable 'counter'
    counter += 1    # Modify the global variable
    print(f"Counter inside function: {counter}")

# Example usage
increment_counter()  # Output: Counter inside function: 1
increment_counter()  # Output: Counter inside function: 2

print(f"Counter outside function: {counter}")  # Output: Counter outside function: 2
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Global Variable**: The variable `counter` is defined at the top level of the module, giving it global scope.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `increment_counter()` intends to modify the global variable `counter`.

3. **Using the Global Keyword**:
   - Inside `increment_counter()`, we declare `global counter`. This tells Python that we are referring to the global variable `counter`, not creating a new local variable.
   - We then increment `counter` by 1.

4. **Function Calls**: Each time we call `increment_counter()`, the global `counter` is incremented, and its updated value is printed.

5. **Accessing Global Variable**: After two calls to `increment_counter()`, we print the value of `counter` outside the function. It reflects the updated value, which is now 2.

### Summary

- The **`global` keyword** allows you to modify global variables inside a function.
- It helps avoid creating local variables that may unintentionally shadow global ones.
- Use it judiciously, as over-reliance on global variables can make your code harder to understand and maintain.
