# Variables

In Python, **variables** are used to store data values. A variable acts as a label or name assigned to a specific value, making it easier to reference that value later in the code.

## Key points about variables

1. **Naming a variable:**

   - Variable names should be descriptive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`).
   - Variable names cannot start with a number and cannot be any of Python's reserved keywords (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`).

2. **Assigning a value to a variable:**

   - You assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (`=`).

3. **Variables are dynamically typed:**
   - You donâ€™t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. Python automatically detects the type based on the value you assign to it.

## Example

```python
# Assigning values to variables
name = "Alice"        # String
age = 25              # Integer
height = 5.6          # Float
is_student = True     # Boolean

# Using variables in expressions
next_year_age = age + 1  # Adds 1 to the current age
greeting = "Hello, " + name  # Concatenates strings

# Printing variables
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice
print("Age:", age)  # Output: Age: 25
```

### Explanation

- **`name = "Alice"`** assigns the string `"Alice"` to the variable `name`.
- **`age = 25`** assigns the integer `25` to the variable `age`.
- **`height = 5.6`** assigns a float (decimal number) to the variable `height`.
- **`is_student = True`** assigns the Boolean value `True` to the variable `is_student`.
- **`next_year_age = age + 1`** demonstrates how to use variables in calculations. It adds `1` to the current `age`.
