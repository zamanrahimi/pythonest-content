# Assignment Operators

In Python, **assignment operators** are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is the basic assignment operator (`=`), but Python also provides several compound assignment operators that combine assignment with another operation.

## Common Assignment Operators

1. **Basic Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
2. **Addition Assignment (`+=`)**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
3. **Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
4. **Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)**: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
5. **Division Assignment (`/=`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
6. **Floor Division Assignment (`//=`)**: Performs floor division on the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
7. **Modulus Assignment (`%=`)**: Takes the modulus using the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
8. **Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)\*\*: Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a code snippet demonstrating these assignment operators:

```python
# Basic Assignment
x = 10
print("Initial value of x:", x)  # Output: Initial value of x: 10

# Addition Assignment
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
print("After addition assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After addition assignment, x: 15

# Subtraction Assignment
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3
print("After subtraction assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After subtraction assignment, x: 12

# Multiplication Assignment
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
print("After multiplication assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After multiplication assignment, x: 24

# Division Assignment
x /= 4  # Equivalent to x = x / 4
print("After division assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After division assignment, x: 6.0

# Floor Division Assignment
x //= 2  # Equivalent to x = x // 2
print("After floor division assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After floor division assignment, x: 3.0

# Modulus Assignment
x %= 2  # Equivalent to x = x % 2
print("After modulus assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After modulus assignment, x: 1.0

# Exponentiation Assignment
x **= 3  # Equivalent to x = x ** 3
print("After exponentiation assignment, x:", x)  # Output: After exponentiation assignment, x: 1.0
```

### Explanation of Each Operator

1. **Basic Assignment (`=`)**:

   - `x = 10` assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.

2. **Addition Assignment (`+=`)**:

   - `x += 5` adds `5` to `x`, so `x` becomes `15`.

3. **Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)**:

   - `x -= 3` subtracts `3` from `x`, so `x` becomes `12`.

4. **Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)**:

   - `x *= 2` multiplies `x` by `2`, so `x` becomes `24`.

5. **Division Assignment (`/=`)**:

   - `x /= 4` divides `x` by `4`, resulting in `6.0` (note the float).

6. **Floor Division Assignment (`//=`)**:

   - `x //= 2` performs floor division, so `x` becomes `3.0`.

7. **Modulus Assignment (`%=`)**:

   - `x %= 2` assigns the remainder of `x` divided by `2`, resulting in `1.0`.

8. **Exponentiation Assignment (`**=`)\*\*:
   - `x **= 3` raises `x` to the power of `3`, resulting in `1.0`.
