# Bitwise Operators

In Python, **bitwise operators** are used to perform operations on binary numbers at the bit level. These operators operate on the binary representations of integers and can manipulate individual bits.

## Common Bitwise Operators

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if both bits are `1`, otherwise returns `0`.
2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`, otherwise returns `0`.
3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if the bits are different (one is `1`, the other is `0`), otherwise returns `0`.
4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of a number (flips `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).
5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, filling with `0` on the right.
6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.

## Example

```python
# Define two numbers
a = 12   # In binary: 1100
b = 5    # In binary: 0101

# Bitwise AND
bitwise_and = a & b        # 1100 & 0101 = 0100 (4)

# Bitwise OR
bitwise_or = a | b         # 1100 | 0101 = 1101 (13)

# Bitwise XOR
bitwise_xor = a ^ b        # 1100 ^ 0101 = 1001 (9)

# Bitwise NOT
bitwise_not_a = ~a         # ~1100 = 0011 (in binary representation is -13 in Python due to two's complement)

# Left Shift
left_shift = a << 2        # 1100 << 2 = 110000 (48 in decimal)

# Right Shift
right_shift = a >> 2       # 1100 >> 2 = 0011 (3 in decimal)

# Print the results
print("Bitwise AND (a & b):", bitwise_and)         # Output: 4
print("Bitwise OR (a | b):", bitwise_or)           # Output: 13
print("Bitwise XOR (a ^ b):", bitwise_xor)         # Output: 9
print("Bitwise NOT (~a):", bitwise_not_a)          # Output: -13
print("Left Shift (a << 2):", left_shift)          # Output: 48
print("Right Shift (a >> 2):", right_shift)        # Output: 3
```

### Explanation of Each Operator

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**:

   - `a & b`: Compares each bit of `1100` (12) and `0101` (5).
     - Result: `0100` (which is `4` in decimal).

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**:

   - `a | b`: Compares each bit of `1100` and `0101`.
     - Result: `1101` (which is `13` in decimal).

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**:

   - `a ^ b`: Compares each bit of `1100` and `0101`.
     - Result: `1001` (which is `9` in decimal).

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**:

   - `~a`: Inverts the bits of `1100`. The result in Python is `-13` due to the two's complement representation of negative numbers.
     - In binary, it would be represented as `0011` (and the sign bit indicates a negative number).

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**:

   - `a << 2`: Shifts the bits of `1100` left by `2` positions.
     - Result: `110000` (which is `48` in decimal).

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**:
   - `a >> 2`: Shifts the bits of `1100` right by `2` positions.
     - Result: `0011` (which is `3` in decimal).
