# Boolean Operators

In Python, **Boolean operators** are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values (True and False). These operators are primarily used in logical expressions and are essential for controlling the flow of programs, especially in conditions and loops.

## Common Boolean Operators

1. **Logical AND (`and`)**: Returns True if both operands are True.
2. **Logical OR (`or`)**: Returns True if at least one of the operands is True.
3. **Logical NOT (`not`)**: Inverts the Boolean value of the operand.

## Example

```python
# Define some Boolean variables
a = True
b = False
c = True

# Logical AND
and_result = a and b      # Returns False because b is False

# Logical OR
or_result = a or b        # Returns True because a is True

# Logical NOT
not_result_a = not a      # Returns False because a is True
not_result_b = not b      # Returns True because b is False

# Print the results
print("Logical AND (a and b):", and_result)          # Output: False
print("Logical OR (a or b):", or_result)              # Output: True
print("Logical NOT (not a):", not_result_a)           # Output: False
print("Logical NOT (not b):", not_result_b)           # Output: True
```

### Explanation of Each Operator

1. **Logical AND (`and`)**:

   - `and_result = a and b`: This expression evaluates to `True` only if both `a` and `b` are `True`. Since `b` is `False`, `and_result` is `False`.

2. **Logical OR (`or`)**:

   - `or_result = a or b`: This expression evaluates to `True` if at least one of `a` or `b` is `True`. Since `a` is `True`, `or_result` is `True`.

3. **Logical NOT (`not`)**:
   - `not_result_a = not a`: This expression inverts the value of `a`. Since `a` is `True`, `not_result_a` becomes `False`.
   - `not_result_b = not b`: This expression inverts the value of `b`. Since `b` is `False`, `not_result_b` becomes `True`.
