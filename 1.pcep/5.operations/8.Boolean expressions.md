# Boolean Expressions

In Python, **Boolean expressions** are expressions that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are typically formed using comparison operators and logical operators. Boolean expressions are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program, particularly in conditional statements (like `if` statements) and loops.

## Components of Boolean Expressions

1. **Comparison Operators**: These are used to compare two values. Common comparison operators include:

   - Equal to (`==`)
   - Not equal to (`!=`)
   - Greater than (`>`)
   - Less than (`<`)
   - Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
   - Less than or equal to (`<=`)

2. **Logical Operators**: These are used to combine Boolean expressions:
   - Logical AND (`and`)
   - Logical OR (`or`)
   - Logical NOT (`not`)

## Example

```python
# Define some variables
x = 10
y = 5

# Comparison expressions
is_equal = (x == y)                # False
is_not_equal = (x != y)            # True
is_greater = (x > y)               # True
is_less_or_equal = (x <= y)        # False

# Combining Boolean expressions with logical operators
combined_and = (x > y) and (y < 3) # False (True and False)
combined_or = (x < y) or (y > 2)   # True (False or True)
negation = not (x == 10)            # False (not True)

# Print the results
print("Is Equal (x == y):", is_equal)                      # Output: False
print("Is Not Equal (x != y):", is_not_equal)              # Output: True
print("Is Greater (x > y):", is_greater)                   # Output: True
print("Is Less or Equal (x <= y):", is_less_or_equal)     # Output: False
print("Combined AND (x > y and y < 3):", combined_and)     # Output: False
print("Combined OR (x < y or y > 2):", combined_or)        # Output: True
print("Negation (not (x == 10)):", negation)                # Output: False
```

### Explanation of Each Expression

1. **Comparison Expressions**:

   - `is_equal = (x == y)`: Checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `10` is not equal to `5`, the result is `False`.
   - `is_not_equal = (x != y)`: Checks if `x` is not equal to `y`. This is `True` because `10` is indeed not equal to `5`.
   - `is_greater = (x > y)`: Checks if `x` is greater than `y`. This is `True` because `10` is greater than `5`.
   - `is_less_or_equal = (x <= y)`: Checks if `x` is less than or equal to `y`. This is `False` because `10` is not less than or equal to `5`.

2. **Combining Boolean Expressions**:
   - `combined_and = (x > y) and (y < 3)`: Evaluates to `False` because although `x > y` is `True`, `y < 3` is `False`, and `True and False` evaluates to `False`.
   - `combined_or = (x < y) or (y > 2)`: Evaluates to `True` because `x < y` is `False`, but `y > 2` is `True`, and `False or True` evaluates to `True`.
   - `negation = not (x == 10)`: Inverts the value of the expression `x == 10`, which is `True`, so `not True` is `False`.
