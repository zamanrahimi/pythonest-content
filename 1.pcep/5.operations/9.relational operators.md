# Relational Operators

In Python, **relational operators** (also known as **comparison operators**) are used to compare two values or expressions. They evaluate to a Boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on the relationship between the operands. These operators are commonly used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a program.

## Common Relational Operators

1. **Equal to (`==`)**: Returns `True` if the values on both sides are equal.
2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Returns `True` if the values on both sides are not equal.
3. **Greater than (`>`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
4. **Less than (`<`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is less than the right operand.
5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

## Example

```python
# Define some variables
a = 10
b = 20
c = 10

# Using relational operators
equal = (a == b)                # False
not_equal = (a != b)            # True
greater_than = (a > b)          # False
less_than = (a < b)             # True
greater_than_equal = (a >= c)   # True
less_than_equal = (b <= c)      # False

# Print the results
print("Equal (a == b):", equal)                       # Output: False
print("Not Equal (a != b):", not_equal)               # Output: True
print("Greater Than (a > b):", greater_than)          # Output: False
print("Less Than (a < b):", less_than)                # Output: True
print("Greater Than or Equal (a >= c):", greater_than_equal)  # Output: True
print("Less Than or Equal (b <= c):", less_than_equal)        # Output: False
```

### Explanation of Each Operator

1. **Equal to (`==`)**:

   - `equal = (a == b)`: Checks if `a` is equal to `b`. Since `10` is not equal to `20`, the result is `False`.

2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**:

   - `not_equal = (a != b)`: Checks if `a` is not equal to `b`. This is `True` because `10` is not equal to `20`.

3. **Greater than (`>`)**:

   - `greater_than = (a > b)`: Checks if `a` is greater than `b`. This is `False` because `10` is not greater than `20`.

4. **Less than (`<`)**:

   - `less_than = (a < b)`: Checks if `a` is less than `b`. This is `True` because `10` is less than `20`.

5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**:

   - `greater_than_equal = (a >= c)`: Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `c`. This is `True` because `10` is equal to `10`.

6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**:
   - `less_than_equal = (b <= c)`: Checks if `b` is less than or equal to `c`. This is `False` because `20` is not less than or equal to `10`.
