# unary & Binary Operators

In Python, operators can be classified into two categories based on the number of operands they operate on: **unary operators** and **binary operators**.

## Unary Operators

**Unary operators** are operators that operate on a single operand. They are typically used to perform operations such as negation or incrementing values.

## Common Unary Operators

1. **Unary Plus (`+`)**: Indicates a positive value (often redundant).
2. **Unary Minus (`-`)**: Negates the value of the operand.
3. **Logical NOT (`not`)**: Inverts the boolean value of the operand.

## Example of Unary Operators

```python
# Unary Operators
a = 5
b = -a  # Unary Minus
c = +a  # Unary Plus (same as a)
d = not (a > 0)  # Logical NOT

print("Value of a:", a)         # Output: Value of a: 5
print("Unary Minus (-a):", b)   # Output: Unary Minus (-a): -5
print("Unary Plus (+a):", c)    # Output: Unary Plus (+a): 5
print("Logical NOT (not a > 0):", d)  # Output: Logical NOT (not a > 0): False
```

## Binary Operators

**Binary operators** are operators that operate on two operands. They are used to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, and comparison.

## Common Binary Operators

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**` (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (e.g., equality, inequality, greater than, less than).
3. **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or` (used to combine boolean expressions).

## Example of Binary Operators

```python
# Binary Operators
x = 10
y = 3

# Arithmetic Operations
addition = x + y          # Addition
subtraction = x - y       # Subtraction
multiplication = x * y    # Multiplication
division = x / y          # Division
modulus = x % y           # Modulus
exponentiation = x ** y   # Exponentiation

# Comparison Operations
is_equal = x == y         # Equal
is_not_equal = x != y     # Not Equal
is_greater = x > y        # Greater than
is_less = x < y           # Less than

# Print the results
print("Addition:", addition)               # Output: Addition: 13
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)         # Output: Subtraction: 7
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)    # Output: Multiplication: 30
print("Division:", division)                # Output: Division: 3.3333333333333335
print("Modulus:", modulus)                  # Output: Modulus: 1
print("Exponentiation:", exponentiation)    # Output: Exponentiation: 1000
print("Is Equal:", is_equal)                # Output: Is Equal: False
print("Is Not Equal:", is_not_equal)        # Output: Is Not Equal: True
print("Is Greater:", is_greater)            # Output: Is Greater: True
print("Is Less:", is_less)                  # Output: Is Less: False
```
