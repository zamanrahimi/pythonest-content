# Priorities and Binding

In Python, **operator precedence** (or priorities) and **binding** (or associativity) determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing correct and efficient code.

## Operator Precedence

**Operator precedence** defines which operators are evaluated first in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.

Hereâ€™s a simplified list of some common operators in Python, ordered by precedence (from highest to lowest):

1. **Parentheses (`()`)**
2. **Exponentiation (`**`)\*\*
3. **Unary plus and minus (`+`, `-`)**
4. **Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, and Modulus (`*`, `/`, `//`, `%`)**
5. **Addition and Subtraction (`+`, `-`)**
6. **Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)**
7. **Logical Operators (`not`, `and`, `or`)**

## Binding (Associativity)

**Binding** (or **associativity**) determines the order in which operators of the same precedence level are evaluated. Most operators in Python are left-to-right associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right. However, exponentiation (`**`) is right-to-left associative.

## Example

Let's look at an example to illustrate operator precedence and binding:

```python
# Example Expression
result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 ** 2 / 5

print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 4.0
```

### Breakdown of the Expression

1. **Step 1**: Evaluate `5 ** 2` (exponentiation has the highest precedence):

   - `5 ** 2 = 25`

2. **Step 2**: Substitute back into the expression:

   - `result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 25 / 5`

3. **Step 3**: Evaluate `25 / 5` (division comes next):

   - `25 / 5 = 5.0`

4. **Step 4**: Substitute back again:

   - `result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5.0`

5. **Step 5**: Evaluate `3 * 4` (multiplication is next):

   - `3 * 4 = 12`

6. **Step 6**: Substitute back:

   - `result = 2 + 12 - 5.0`

7. **Step 7**: Evaluate `2 + 12` (addition):

   - `2 + 12 = 14`

8. **Step 8**: Substitute back:

   - `result = 14 - 5.0`

9. **Step 9**: Finally, evaluate `14 - 5.0` (subtraction):
   - `14 - 5.0 = 9.0`

### Final Result

The final value of `result` is `9.0`.
