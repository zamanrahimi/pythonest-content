# parameters vs arguments
In Python, **parameters** and **arguments** are related concepts but refer to different aspects of functions. Understanding the distinction between the two is essential for effective function definition and usage.

### Parameters

**Parameters** are the variables listed in a function’s definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it is called. Parameters define what inputs a function can accept.

### Arguments

**Arguments** are the actual values or data you pass to a function when you call it. They correspond to the parameters defined in the function. Arguments provide the input that the function needs to perform its task.

### Key Differences

- **Parameters**: Defined in the function declaration and serve as placeholders.
- **Arguments**: Actual values supplied to the function when calling it.

### Example of Parameters and Arguments

Here’s an example that demonstrates the difference between parameters and arguments:

```python
def greet(name, age):  # 'name' and 'age' are parameters
    """Function to greet a person with their name and age."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

# Calling the function with arguments
greeting_message = greet("Alice", 30)  # "Alice" and 30 are arguments
print(greeting_message)  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `greet(name, age)` is defined with two parameters: `name` and `age`. These are placeholders that specify what type of information the function expects to receive.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function is called with the arguments `"Alice"` and `30`. Here, `"Alice"` corresponds to the `name` parameter, and `30` corresponds to the `age` parameter.

3. **Output**:
   - The function processes the provided arguments and returns a greeting message. In this case, it returns `"Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old."`.

### Summary

- **Parameters** are the names defined in a function’s declaration, serving as placeholders for the data the function will operate on.
- **Arguments** are the actual values passed to the function when it is called, corresponding to the parameters defined in the function.
- Understanding this distinction helps in defining functions and passing the appropriate data when calling them, leading to clearer and more effective code.
