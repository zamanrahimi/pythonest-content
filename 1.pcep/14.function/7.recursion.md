# Recursion
Recursion in Python (and programming in general) is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive functions typically break a problem down into smaller sub-problems, each of which is similar to the original problem. The recursion continues until a base case is reached, which is a condition that stops further recursive calls.

### Key Concepts of Recursion

1. **Base Case**: This is the condition under which the recursion stops. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
  
2. **Recursive Case**: This is where the function calls itself with a modified argument, gradually moving towards the base case.

3. **Stack Frames**: Each function call creates a new stack frame in memory. When the base case is reached, the stack frames are popped off the stack, returning values back through the chain of function calls.

### Example of Recursion

A common example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a number, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. The factorial of \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)) can be defined recursively as:

- \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \) for \( n > 0 \)
- \( 0! = 1 \) (base case)

Here’s how you can implement it in Python:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion."""
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the recursive function
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
print(factorial(0))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `factorial(n)` calculates the factorial of `n`.

2. **Base Case**: 
   - The condition `if n == 0:` checks if `n` is zero. If it is, the function returns `1` because \( 0! \) is defined as `1`.

3. **Recursive Case**: 
   - The line `return n * factorial(n - 1)` calls the function itself with the argument `n - 1`, thus reducing the problem size until it reaches the base case.

4. **Function Calls**:
   - When `factorial(5)` is called, it goes through the following steps:
     - \( 5! = 5 \times 4! \)
     - \( 4! = 4 \times 3! \)
     - \( 3! = 3 \times 2! \)
     - \( 2! = 2 \times 1! \)
     - \( 1! = 1 \times 0! \)
     - \( 0! = 1 \) (base case)
   - The values are then returned and multiplied together to give `120`.

### Another Example: Fibonacci Sequence

Recursion is also commonly used to calculate numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

- \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n > 1 \)
- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)

Here’s how you can implement it in Python:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion."""
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Test the recursive function
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

### Summary

- Recursion is a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
- Each recursive function must have a base case to prevent infinite recursion.
- While recursion can lead to elegant solutions, it's important to consider the depth of recursion and potential stack overflow issues, especially for large input sizes. For such cases, iterative solutions or optimizing recursion (like using memoization) might be more appropriate.
