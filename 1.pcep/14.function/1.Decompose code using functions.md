# Decomposing Code Using Functions
Decomposing code using functions is a fundamental programming practice that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts. This approach enhances code readability, reusability, and maintainability. By using functions, you can isolate specific tasks, making it easier to understand and debug the code.

### Benefits of Decomposing Code Using Functions

1. **Modularity**: Functions allow you to encapsulate functionality, making it easier to modify or replace parts of the code without affecting the entire program.
2. **Reusability**: Once defined, functions can be reused throughout the codebase, reducing redundancy and saving time.
3. **Readability**: Well-named functions can describe their purpose, making the code easier to read and understand.
4. **Testing**: Functions can be tested independently, simplifying the debugging process.

### Example of Decomposing Code Using Functions

Let's say we want to create a simple program that calculates the area of different shapes: a rectangle and a circle. Instead of writing all the logic in a single block, we can decompose the code into functions.

```python
import math

def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle."""
    return length * width

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """Calculate the area of a circle."""
    return math.pi * (radius ** 2)

def main():
    # Get rectangle dimensions from the user
    length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
    width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
    rectangle_area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)
    print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {rectangle_area:.2f}")

    # Get circle radius from the user
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    circle_area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
    print(f"The area of the circle is: {circle_area:.2f}")

# Call the main function to execute the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `calculate_rectangle_area(length, width)`: This function calculates and returns the area of a rectangle using the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \).
   - `calculate_circle_area(radius)`: This function calculates and returns the area of a circle using the formula \( \text{Area} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \). The `math` module is used to access the value of \( \pi \).

2. **Main Function**:
   - The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter the dimensions for the rectangle and the radius for the circle.
   - It calls the appropriate functions to calculate the areas and prints the results.

3. **Execution Block**:
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

### Summary

- Decomposing code using functions improves code organization and clarity.
- In the example, the program is structured into smaller functions for specific tasks (calculating areas), making it easier to maintain and understand.
- This practice not only simplifies the current task but also sets the stage for reusing the functions in other programs or parts of the same program in the future.
