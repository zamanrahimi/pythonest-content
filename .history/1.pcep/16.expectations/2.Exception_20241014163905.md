# Exception
In Python, **`Exception`** is the base class for most built-in exceptions. It is a subclass of `BaseException` and is designed to be used for normal error handling. When you catch exceptions in your code, you typically catch instances of `Exception` or its subclasses. This allows you to handle a wide range of errors while still being able to catch specific exceptions when needed.

### Characteristics of Exception

- **Normal Errors**: `Exception` is used for standard error handling, such as file not found errors, type errors, value errors, etc.
- **Custom Exceptions**: You can create your own custom exceptions by subclassing `Exception`.
- **Catching Exceptions**: It is common to use `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions derived from `Exception`.

### Example of Using Exception

Hereâ€™s a simple example that demonstrates how to use the `Exception` class to handle errors gracefully:

```python
def divide_numbers(num1, num2):
    try:
        result = num1 / num2
        return f"The result is: {result}"
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        return f"Error: Cannot divide by zero. Details: {e}"
    except TypeError as e:
        return f"Error: Invalid input type. Please provide numbers. Details: {e}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}"

# Example usages
print(divide_numbers(10, 2))    # Output: The result is: 5.0
print(divide_numbers(10, 0))    # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero. Details: division by zero
print(divide_numbers(10, 'a'))  # Output: Error: Invalid input type. Please provide numbers. Details: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
print(divide_numbers(None, 5))   # Output: Error: Invalid input type. Please provide numbers. Details: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'NoneType' and 'int'
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `divide_numbers(num1, num2)` attempts to divide two numbers.

2. **Try Block**: The division operation is enclosed within a `try` block.

3. **Except Blocks**:
   - **`ZeroDivisionError`**: This specific block catches division by zero errors. If `num2` is zero, the corresponding error message is returned.
   - **`TypeError`**: This block catches errors related to invalid input types (e.g., if a string is passed instead of a number).
   - **`Exception`**: The final `except` block is a catch-all for any other unexpected exceptions. It returns a general error message with details.

4. **Example Usages**:
   - The first call to `divide_numbers(10, 2)` performs the division successfully and returns the result.
   - The second call `divide_numbers(10, 0)` raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is caught and returns a specific error message.
   - The third call `divide_numbers(10, 'a')` raises a `TypeError`, which is also caught and returns an appropriate error message.
   - The fourth call `divide_numbers(None, 5)` raises a `TypeError` as well, showing that various invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

### Summary

- The **`Exception` class** is the standard way to handle errors in Python programs.
- You can catch specific exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError` or `TypeError`) for tailored error handling, while also providing a generic handler for unexpected errors using the `Exception` class.
- This approach leads to more robust and user-friendly applications by ensuring that errors are handled gracefully without crashing the program.
