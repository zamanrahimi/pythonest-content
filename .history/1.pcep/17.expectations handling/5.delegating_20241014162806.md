# delegating
In Python, **delegating** refers to the practice of passing responsibility for handling an operation or an exception to another function or method. This is particularly useful in scenarios where one function or class method might encounter an error that it can't handle adequately, and instead of managing the error itself, it delegates the error handling to another function or method that is more suited to deal with it.

### Delegating Exception Handling

When it comes to exception handling, delegating allows one part of your code to pass the responsibility of handling a specific exception to another part. This can make your code cleaner and separate the logic of handling exceptions from the main logic.

### Example of Delegating Exception Handling

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates delegation in the context of exception handling:

```python
def process_data(data):
    """Process the input data and delegate error handling."""
    try:
        result = calculate_average(data)
        return f"The average is: {result}"
    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        return handle_exception(e)

def calculate_average(data):
    """Calculate the average of a list of numbers."""
    if not data:  # Check for empty list
        raise ValueError("The data list is empty.")
    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in data):  # Check for non-numeric values
        raise TypeError("All elements in the data list must be numbers.")
    return sum(data) / len(data)

def handle_exception(exception):
    """Handle exceptions and provide a meaningful message."""
    if isinstance(exception, ValueError):
        return "Error: " + str(exception)
    elif isinstance(exception, TypeError):
        return "Error: " + str(exception)
    return "An unknown error occurred."

# Example usages
print(process_data([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: The average is: 20.0
print(process_data([]))             # Output: Error: The data list is empty.
print(process_data([10, 'a', 30]))  # Output: Error: All elements in the data list must be numbers.
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - **`process_data(data)`**: This function takes a list of numbers and attempts to calculate the average. If an exception occurs during the calculation, it delegates the handling of that exception to the `handle_exception` function.
   - **`calculate_average(data)`**: This function calculates the average of the given list. It raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty and a `TypeError` if any element is not a number.
   - **`handle_exception(exception)`**: This function receives an exception and returns a meaningful error message based on the type of the exception.

2. **Try-Except Block**:
   - In `process_data`, the `try` block contains the call to `calculate_average(data)`. If this call raises an exception, the control jumps to the corresponding `except` block.
   - The exceptions caught (`ValueError` and `TypeError`) are then passed to the `handle_exception` function, which determines how to respond to the error.

3. **Example Usages**: 
   - When calling `process_data([10, 20, 30])`, it calculates the average successfully.
   - When calling `process_data([])`, it raises a `ValueError` for the empty list, which is handled by `handle_exception`.
   - When calling `process_data([10, 'a', 30])`, it raises a `TypeError`, also handled by `handle_exception`.

### Summary

- **Delegating** is a way to pass the responsibility of handling errors to another function or method, allowing for cleaner code and separation of concerns.
- This pattern is especially useful when you want to centralize error handling or when the primary function cannot handle an exception effectively.
- By using delegation, you can keep your code modular and easier to maintain.
