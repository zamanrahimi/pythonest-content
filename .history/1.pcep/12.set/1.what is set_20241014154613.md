# what is set
In Python, a **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets cannot have duplicate values, and they are also unordered, meaning the items do not have an index. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from them.

### Key characteristics of a set:
1. **Unordered**: Elements have no specific order.
2. **No duplicates**: Each element must be unique.
3. **Mutable**: You can change the set by adding or removing elements.
4. **Immutable elements**: The elements in the set must be of an immutable type, such as numbers, strings, or tuples.

### Example:
```python
# Creating a set
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}  # Note that "apple" is duplicated

# Displaying the set
print(fruits)
```

#### Output:
```python
{'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}
```

Even though `"apple"` is listed twice, it appears only once in the set because sets automatically remove duplicates.

### Operations on sets:

- **Adding an element**:
  ```python
  fruits.add("orange")
  print(fruits)
  ```

- **Removing an element**:
  ```python
  fruits.remove("banana")
  print(fruits)
  ```

- **Set operations** (union, intersection, etc.):
  ```python
  tropical = {"pineapple", "banana", "mango"}
  result = fruits.union(tropical)  # Union of both sets
  print(result)
  ```

Sets are especially useful when you need to keep track of unique items or perform mathematical operations like unions and intersections.
