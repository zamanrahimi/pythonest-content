# Immutability
**Immutability** in Python refers to the property of certain data types where once an object is created, its value cannot be changed. This means that any modification to an immutable object creates a new object instead of altering the original one.

### Immutable Data Types in Python:
1. **Integers** (`int`)
2. **Floating-Point Numbers** (`float`)
3. **Strings** (`str`)
4. **Tuples** (`tuple`)
5. **Booleans** (`bool`)
6. **Frozensets** (`frozenset`)

In contrast, mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) allow modification of their content without changing their identity.

### Example 1: Immutable Strings
Once a string is created, you cannot modify its content directly. Any operation that seems to modify a string will actually return a new string.

```python
text = "Hello"
# Trying to change the first character (will raise an error)
try:
    text[0] = "h"  # Strings are immutable
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

To "change" a string, you need to create a new one:

```python
# Creating a new string by modifying the original
new_text = "h" + text[1:]
print(new_text)  # Output: hello
```

### Example 2: Immutable Tuples
Tuples are also immutable, meaning you cannot change their elements after creation.

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
# Trying to change an element in the tuple (will raise an error)
try:
    my_tuple[1] = 25  # Tuples are immutable
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

If you want to change the tuple, you have to create a new one:

```python
# Creating a new tuple
new_tuple = my_tuple[:1] + (25,) + my_tuple[2:]
print(new_tuple)  # Output: (10, 25, 30)
```

### Example 3: Immutable Integers
Integers are also immutable, so even if you "change" an integer's value, what happens is that a new integer object is created.

```python
x = 5
print(id(x))  # Outputs the memory address of x

# Changing the value of x creates a new object
x = x + 1
print(x)  # Output: 6
print(id(x))  # Different memory address, a new object is created
```

### Why Does Immutability Matter?
- **Performance**: Immutable objects can be more memory efficient because they can be reused. For example, small integers and short strings are often cached and reused in Python.
- **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because they cannot be modified after creation, preventing issues when sharing data across threads.
- **Reliability**: Since immutable objects cannot change, they ensure that data remains consistent, avoiding unintended side effects.

### Mutable vs Immutable Example:
To contrast, consider mutable and immutable types with lists and strings:

```python
# Immutable string
string = "hello"
string += " world"  # Creates a new string
print(string)  # Output: hello world

# Mutable list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the existing list
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In the case of the string, concatenation results in a new string. In the case of the list, the append operation modifies the original list directly.

### Summary:
- **Immutable objects** (like strings, tuples, and integers) cannot be changed once created.
- Any operation that seems to modify an immutable object will create a new object.
- Immutability is useful for ensuring data consistency, thread safety, and better memory management.
