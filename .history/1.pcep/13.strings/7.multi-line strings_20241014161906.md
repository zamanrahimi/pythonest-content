# multi-line strings
In Python, **multi-line strings** are strings that span multiple lines. You can create multi-line strings using triple quotes: either triple single quotes (`''' '''`) or triple double quotes (`""" """`). This feature allows you to include line breaks and make your code more readable, especially when dealing with long texts, documentation, or formatted output.

### Creating Multi-Line Strings

1. **Using Triple Single Quotes (`''' '''`):**
   You can create a multi-line string by enclosing your text within triple single quotes.

   #### Example:
   ```python
   multi_line_string = '''This is a multi-line string.
   It can span multiple lines.
   Each new line is preserved.'''
   print(multi_line_string)
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   This is a multi-line string.
   It can span multiple lines.
   Each new line is preserved.
   ```

2. **Using Triple Double Quotes (`""" """`):**
   Similarly, you can use triple double quotes to create a multi-line string.

   #### Example:
   ```python
   multi_line_string = """This is another example of a multi-line string.
   Using triple double quotes works the same way.
   Line breaks will be preserved here too."""
   print(multi_line_string)
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   This is another example of a multi-line string.
   Using triple double quotes works the same way.
   Line breaks will be preserved here too.
   ```

### Preserving Line Breaks
The line breaks within the multi-line string are preserved when you print the string. This is useful for formatting text that needs to maintain a specific structure or layout.

### Example: Formatting a Poem
Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use a multi-line string to format a poem:

```python
poem = """Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Python is fun,
And so are you!"""

print(poem)
```

**Output:**
```
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Python is fun,
And so are you!
```

### Example: Documentation Strings (Docstrings)
Multi-line strings are often used for documentation strings (docstrings) in functions, classes, and modules. Docstrings provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, or methods.

```python
def greet():
    """This function greets the user.
    
    It prints a welcome message to the console.
    """
    print("Hello, welcome to Python programming!")

# Calling the function
greet()

# Accessing the docstring
print(greet.__doc__)
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, welcome to Python programming!
This function greets the user.
    
    It prints a welcome message to the console.
```

### Summary
- **Multi-line strings** are defined using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).
- They can span multiple lines and preserve line breaks.
- Useful for formatting long texts, writing documentation, or creating structured output.
