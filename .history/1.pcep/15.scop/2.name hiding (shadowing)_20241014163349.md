# name hiding
In Python, **name hiding** (also known as **shadowing**) occurs when a variable in a certain scope has the same name as a variable in a broader scope. This can lead to confusion because the inner variable "hides" the outer variable. When you refer to that variable name, Python will use the one in the current scope rather than the one from the outer scope.

### Scope Levels

1. **Local Scope**: The innermost scope, which refers to variables defined inside a function or block.
2. **Enclosing Scope**: The scope of the enclosing function, applicable when dealing with nested functions.
3. **Global Scope**: The top-level scope, which includes variables defined at the top level of a script or module.
4. **Built-in Scope**: The scope of built-in names in Python, like `len()` or `print()`.

### Example of Name Hiding (Shadowing)

Hereâ€™s an example that illustrates name hiding in Python:

```python
# Global variable
x = 10

def outer_function():
    # Enclosing scope variable
    x = 20
    
    def inner_function():
        # Local variable
        x = 30
        print("Inner function x:", x)  # This will print the local x (30)
    
    inner_function()
    print("Outer function x:", x)  # This will print the enclosing x (20)

# Calling the outer function
outer_function()
print("Global x:", x)  # This will print the global x (10)
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Global Variable**: `x = 10` is defined in the global scope.

2. **Outer Function**: 
   - The `outer_function()` defines its own variable `x` with a value of `20`, which is in the enclosing scope.
   - It also defines `inner_function()`, which has its own variable `x` set to `30`.

3. **Inner Function**: 
   - When `inner_function()` is called, it prints its local variable `x`, which is `30`, because it shadows the variable `x` in the outer scope.

4. **After Inner Function**: 
   - After calling `inner_function()`, control returns to `outer_function()`, which prints its own `x`, which is `20`.

5. **Global Scope**: Finally, the global `x` is printed outside of any functions, showing that it remains `10`.

### Output

When the above code is executed, the output will be:

```
Inner function x: 30
Outer function x: 20
Global x: 10
```

### Summary

- **Name hiding (shadowing)** occurs when a local variable has the same name as a variable in an outer scope.
- Python resolves variable names by searching from the innermost scope (local) to the outermost (global).
- This can lead to confusion, so it's generally a good practice to avoid using the same variable names in different scopes, especially in larger programs.
