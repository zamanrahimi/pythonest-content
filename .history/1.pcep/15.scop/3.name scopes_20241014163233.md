# name scopes
In Python, **name scopes** refer to the regions of your code where a name (such as a variable or a function) can be accessed. Understanding name scopes is crucial for avoiding naming conflicts and ensuring that your code behaves as expected. Python uses a concept called **LEGB** (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) to determine the scope in which a name is resolved.

### Types of Name Scopes

1. **Local Scope**: Names assigned within a function are in the local scope of that function. They can only be accessed from within that function.

2. **Enclosing Scope**: This refers to the scope of any enclosing (nested) function. If a function is defined inside another function, the inner function can access names from the outer function's scope.

3. **Global Scope**: Names defined at the top level of a script or module have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the code within that module.

4. **Built-in Scope**: This contains names that are always available in Python, such as `print()`, `len()`, etc. These are built-in functions and exceptions.

### Example of Name Scopes

Hereâ€™s an example that illustrates different name scopes in Python:

```python
# Global variable
global_var = "I am a global variable"

def outer_function():
    # Enclosing variable
    enclosing_var = "I am from the outer function"

    def inner_function():
        # Local variable
        local_var = "I am a local variable"
        print(local_var)            # Accessing local variable
        print(enclosing_var)        # Accessing enclosing variable
        print(global_var)          # Accessing global variable

    inner_function()
    print(global_var)              # Accessing global variable
    # print(local_var)            # This would raise a NameError

outer_function()
# print(enclosing_var)           # This would raise a NameError
print(global_var)                # Accessing global variable
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Global Variable**: The variable `global_var` is defined outside any function and has global scope. It can be accessed anywhere in the module.

2. **Outer Function**: The `outer_function()` defines a variable `enclosing_var` which is in the enclosing scope of the nested `inner_function()`.

3. **Inner Function**: The `inner_function()` defines a local variable `local_var`, which can only be accessed within that function.

4. **Accessing Variables**:
   - Inside `inner_function()`, we can access `local_var`, `enclosing_var`, and `global_var` because of the scope rules.
   - After calling `inner_function()`, we print `global_var` again in `outer_function()`, which works because it's in the global scope.
   - Attempting to print `local_var` in `outer_function()` or `enclosing_var` in the global scope will raise a `NameError`, as they are out of scope.

### Summary

- Understanding name scopes is essential for managing variable visibility and avoiding naming conflicts in Python.
- The **LEGB** rule determines how names are resolved based on their scope: Local > Enclosing > Global > Built-in.
- Proper scope management ensures that your code is modular and less prone to errors related to variable access.
