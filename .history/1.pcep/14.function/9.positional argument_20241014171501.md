# positional arguments
In Python, **positional arguments** are the most common type of arguments passed to functions. They are called "positional" because the value of each argument is assigned to a parameter based on its position in the function call. The first argument is assigned to the first parameter, the second argument to the second parameter, and so on.

### Key Characteristics of Positional Arguments

- **Order Matters**: The order in which you provide the arguments matters. If the order is changed, the values assigned to the parameters will also change accordingly.
- **Required**: Positional arguments are required unless default values are provided for the parameters. If a required positional argument is not provided, Python will raise a `TypeError`.

### Example of Positional Arguments

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates the use of positional arguments in a function:

```python
def greet(name, age):
    """Function that greets a person with their name and age."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

# Calling the function with positional arguments
greeting1 = greet("Alice", 30)
greeting2 = greet("Bob", 25)

print(greeting1)  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.
print(greeting2)  # Output: Hello, Bob! You are 25 years old.
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `greet(name, age)` takes two parameters: `name` and `age`.
   - It returns a formatted string greeting the person with their name and age.

2. **Function Calls**:
   - When calling `greet("Alice", 30)`, the string `"Alice"` is assigned to the parameter `name`, and the integer `30` is assigned to the parameter `age`.
   - In the second call `greet("Bob", 25)`, `"Bob"` is assigned to `name`, and `25` is assigned to `age`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the greetings for both `Alice` and `Bob`, which are then printed.

### Important Notes:

- If you were to change the order of the arguments, the output would change accordingly:

```python
# Calling the function with positional arguments in a different order
greeting3 = greet(30, "Alice")  # Incorrect order
print(greeting3)  # Output: Hello, 30! You are Alice years old.
```

This would produce a misleading greeting since the age and name have been swapped.

### Summary

- **Positional arguments** are passed to functions based on their order in the function call.
- The first argument corresponds to the first parameter, the second argument to the second parameter, and so forth.
- They are required unless default values are provided, and changing the order of arguments will change which parameter receives which value.
