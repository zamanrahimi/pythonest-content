# yield
In Python, the **`yield`** statement is used within a function to create a generator. A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing the entire sequence in memory at once. Instead of returning a single value like a regular function, a generator can yield multiple values, pausing its state between each yield and resuming where it left off when called again.

### Characteristics of `yield`

- **State Preservation**: When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over. Each call to `next()` on the generator resumes execution until the next `yield` statement is encountered, at which point the function pauses and returns the yielded value.
- **Memory Efficient**: Generators are memory efficient because they produce values on-the-fly and only keep track of their state, rather than storing an entire list or sequence in memory.

### Example of `yield`

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use `yield` in a generator function:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    """Generator function that counts up to n."""
    count = 1
    while count <= n:
        yield count  # Yield the current count
        count += 1   # Increment the count

# Example usage
counter = count_up_to(5)

# Iterate through the generator
for number in counter:
    print(number)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (each on a new line)
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function `count_up_to(n)` is defined as a generator function that counts from `1` to `n`.
   - Inside the function, a local variable `count` is initialized to `1`.

2. **While Loop**: 
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - The `yield count` statement pauses the function and returns the current value of `count` each time it is called.

3. **Incrementing Count**: 
   - After yielding the value, the function increments `count` by `1`.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - The generator function is called with `count_up_to(5)`, which returns a generator object.
   - The `for` loop iterates over the generator, calling `next()` internally. Each iteration retrieves the next value yielded by the generator until all values are exhausted.

### Another Example: Yielding Multiple Values

You can also use `yield` to produce a series of values without having to create a complete list beforehand. Here’s a more complex example:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(limit):
    """Generator function that generates Fibonacci numbers up to a limit."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= limit:
        yield a  # Yield the current Fibonacci number
        a, b = b, a + b  # Update to the next Fibonacci numbers

# Example usage
fibonacci_gen = fibonacci_sequence(10)

# Print Fibonacci numbers up to 10
for number in fibonacci_gen:
    print(number)  # Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (each on a new line)
```

### Explanation of the Fibonacci Example:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function `fibonacci_sequence(limit)` generates Fibonacci numbers up to the specified `limit`.

2. **Local Variables**: 
   - The local variables `a` and `b` are initialized to the first two Fibonacci numbers (`0` and `1`).

3. **While Loop**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `limit`.
   - Each Fibonacci number is yielded one at a time.

4. **Updating Values**: 
   - The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the next numbers in the Fibonacci sequence after each yield.

5. **Example Usage**: 
   - When the generator is iterated, it yields Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit (`10`), producing the output `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8`.

### Summary

- The **`yield`** statement is used in generator functions to produce a series of values lazily, allowing you to iterate over them without storing the entire sequence in memory.
- Generators provide a way to work with potentially infinite sequences in a memory-efficient manner.
- By using `yield`, you can create complex iterators, such as Fibonacci sequences or any other sequence that requires maintaining state between iterations.
