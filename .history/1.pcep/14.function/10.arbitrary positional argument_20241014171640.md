# arbitrary positional argument
In Python, arbitrary positional arguments allow a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. This is accomplished using the asterisk (`*`) syntax in the function definition. When a function is defined with `*args`, it can accept any number of positional arguments, which are then accessible as a tuple within the function.

### Characteristics of Arbitrary Positional Arguments

1. **Flexibility**: Functions can accept an indefinite number of arguments, making them more versatile.
2. **Tuple**: The arguments passed are accessible as a tuple, allowing for easy iteration and manipulation.
3. **Order Matters**: The arguments must be provided in the order defined in the function signature, with positional arguments coming before `*args`.

### Example of Arbitrary Positional Arguments

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how to use arbitrary positional arguments in a function:

```python
def summarize_numbers(*args):
    """Summarizes a list of numbers by calculating the sum and average."""
    total = sum(args)         # Calculate the sum of all arguments
    count = len(args)         # Count how many arguments were passed
    average = total / count if count > 0 else 0  # Calculate the average
    return total, average

# Calling the function with different numbers of arguments
sum1, avg1 = summarize_numbers(10, 20, 30)
print(f"Total: {sum1}, Average: {avg1}")  # Output: Total: 60, Average: 20.0

sum2, avg2 = summarize_numbers(5, 15)
print(f"Total: {sum2}, Average: {avg2}")  # Output: Total: 20, Average: 10.0

sum3, avg3 = summarize_numbers()  # No arguments passed
print(f"Total: {sum3}, Average: {avg3}")  # Output: Total: 0, Average: 0
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `summarize_numbers(*args)` is defined to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments using `*args`.

2. **Calculating Total and Average**:
   - Inside the function, `sum(args)` computes the total of all passed arguments.
   - `len(args)` counts how many arguments were provided.
   - The average is calculated by dividing the total by the count, ensuring to handle the case where no arguments are passed (to avoid division by zero).

3. **Function Calls**:
   - The first call `summarize_numbers(10, 20, 30)` passes three arguments, and the function returns a total of `60` and an average of `20.0`.
   - The second call `summarize_numbers(5, 15)` returns a total of `20` and an average of `10.0`.
   - The third call `summarize_numbers()` is made without any arguments, resulting in a total of `0` and an average of `0`.

### Summary

- **Arbitrary positional arguments** provide flexibility in function definitions, allowing for a variable number of input values.
- By using `*args`, you can capture these values as a tuple, which can be processed within the function.
- This feature is particularly useful when the exact number of inputs cannot be predetermined or when creating functions that need to handle multiple items in a generalized way.
