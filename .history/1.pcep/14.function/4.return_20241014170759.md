# return
In Python, the `return` statement is used in a function to exit the function and send a value back to the caller. When a function is called, it may perform some operations, and if a `return` statement is encountered, the function will immediately stop executing, and the specified value will be returned to wherever the function was called.

### Characteristics of the `return` Statement

1. **Exits the Function**: When `return` is executed, the function stops running, and control is returned to the calling context.
2. **Returns a Value**: The value provided with the `return` statement can be of any data type (integer, float, string, list, etc.). If no value is specified, `None` is returned by default.
3. **Multiple Return Statements**: A function can have multiple `return` statements, which allows it to return different values based on conditions.

### Example of Using `return`

Here’s a simple example that demonstrates how the `return` statement works in a function:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Function to add two numbers and return the result."""
    result = a + b  # Calculate the sum
    return result    # Return the result

# Calling the function
sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(f"The sum is: {sum_result}")  # Output: The sum is: 8

# Another example with different values
another_sum = add_numbers(10, 15)
print(f"The sum is: {another_sum}")  # Output: The sum is: 25
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `add_numbers(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It calculates their sum and stores it in the variable `result`.

2. **Return Statement**: The `return result` statement sends the calculated sum back to the caller. 

3. **Function Calls**:
   - The first call `add_numbers(5, 3)` returns `8`, which is stored in the variable `sum_result`. This value is then printed.
   - The second call `add_numbers(10, 15)` returns `25`, which is printed as well.

### Returning Multiple Values

Python allows you to return multiple values from a function using a tuple. Here’s a quick example:

```python
def calculate_area_perimeter(length, width):
    """Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle."""
    area = length * width
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    return area, perimeter  # Return both values as a tuple

# Calling the function
area, perimeter = calculate_area_perimeter(5, 3)
print(f"Area: {area}, Perimeter: {perimeter}")  # Output: Area: 15, Perimeter: 16
```

### Explanation of Multiple Values:

- In the `calculate_area_perimeter` function, both the area and perimeter are calculated and returned as a tuple.
- When calling the function, the returned values are unpacked into the variables `area` and `perimeter`.

### Summary

- The `return` statement is essential for sending values back from functions in Python.
- It allows functions to provide results that can be used elsewhere in the code.
- You can return a single value, or multiple values as a tuple, depending on the needs of your program.
